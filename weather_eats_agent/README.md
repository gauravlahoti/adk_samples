# WeatherEats Agent 🍽️🌤️

An AI-powered restaurant discovery agent that combines **live weather data** and **real-time places search** to deliver context-aware dining recommendations — and optionally emails them to you.

Built with [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and powered by Gemini, it connects to external services exclusively through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers.

## The Problem

Finding the right restaurant is harder than it should be. You search for "best restaurants near me" and get a list, but it doesn't consider the weather — recommending a rooftop bar when it's pouring rain, or a cozy indoor spot when the weather is perfect for outdoor dining.

People end up making poor dining choices, arriving at restaurants that don't match the conditions, or spending too much time researching and cross-referencing weather apps with restaurant reviews.

## What This Agent Solves

The agent acts as a context-aware dining concierge. When you ask for restaurant recommendations, the agent:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Checks Weather** | Fetches live weather conditions for your location |
| **Searches Places** | Finds real restaurants via Google Maps (no hallucinated data) |
| **Filters by Context** | Rain → indoor venues, Sunny → rooftop/outdoor suitable |
| **Ranks Results** | Prioritizes by rating, weather-fit, and your preferences |
| **Emails Results** | Optionally sends recommendations to your inbox |

---

## Features

- 🌦️ **Live weather lookup** before every restaurant search — recommendations adapt to current conditions (rain → indoor, sunny → rooftop, etc.)
- 🗺️ **Real-time restaurant search** via Google Maps Places — no hallucinated data, only live results
- 📧 **Email delivery** of recommendations via Resend
- 🔁 **Follow-up queries** — refine by cuisine, budget, or preference without re-entering your location
- 🛡️ **Safety guardrails** — content filtering enabled across all harm categories

## MCP Servers

### 1. Google Maps MCP (`mapstools.googleapis.com/mcp`)

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Transport | Streamable HTTP |
| Auth | `X-Goog-Api-Key` header |
| Tools used | `lookup_weather`, `search_places` |

Provides live weather conditions and nearby restaurant data. The agent always calls `lookup_weather` first to determine the dining context (indoor/outdoor suitability), then calls `search_places` to retrieve real restaurant listings.

### 2. Resend MCP (`resend-mcp` via npx)

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Transport | stdio |
| Package | [`resend-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resend-mcp) |
| Tools used | `send-email` |

Handles email delivery of recommendations. Launched as a child process via `npx -y resend-mcp`, with `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` injected via environment variables.

> **Note:** On Resend's free tier with `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender, emails can only be delivered to the address registered with your Resend account. To send to any recipient, [verify a custom domain](https://resend.com/domains) and update `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS`.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.14
- Node.js + `npx` (for the Resend MCP server)
- A Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled
- A [Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis) with Maps and Places APIs enabled
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) account and API key

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd weather_eats_agent
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following variables
(use `.env.example` as a reference):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then open .env and fill in your actual values
```

`.env` variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` | Set to `1` to use Vertex AI |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | Your GCP project ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | GCP region (e.g. `us-central1`) |
| `MODEL` | Gemini model name (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Google Maps API key |
| `MAPS_MCP_URL` | Google Maps MCP endpoint URL |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key |
| `SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` | Sender email address for Resend |

### 5. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Running the Agent

Start the ADK web interface:

```bash
adk web
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and select **weather_eats_agent**.

## Example Interactions

```
User: Suggest dining options in Connaught Place, New Delhi.

## Security

- `.env` is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- API keys are read from environment variables — never hardcoded
- All four Gemini harm categories are blocked at `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE`
- Restaurant data is sourced exclusively from live tool calls — the LLM is explicitly prohibited from using training knowledge for place data
